Building a site similar to *my.maktab.uz* was a challenging yet rewarding project. By focusing on clean design, responsive layout, and seamless user interaction, I created a functional and visually appealing website. The process involved applying both frontend and backend development skills, ensuring that all elements worked together to create a smooth user experience. While the design and features are similar to *my.maktab.uz*, I also made custom modifications to better suit the needs of the users and the specific goals of the project.
